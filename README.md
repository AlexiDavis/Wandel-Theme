### Description:
	Wandel is a responsive Tumblr theme.
	On larger screens it's a two-column theme with a right sidebar.
	On smaller screens the sidebar merges with the content flow into
	one column.

### Uses:
- JavaScript; jQuery 1.10.1; jQuery UI 1.10.3;
- Google Fonts: Raleway, Armata, "Denk One", Monda
- Mobile navigation inspired by Chris Coyier's post: http://css-tricks.com/convert-menu-to-dropdown/
		
### Requires:
- Tumblr account
- access to "Customize" pane

### How to Use:
1. On the Tumblr dashboard, click "Customize" in the sidebar
	(or, click the gear icon at the top of the page, and then click "Edit theme" under "Website Theme").
2. In the side panel it will list what theme you are currently using. Select "Edit HTML >".
3. Select the entirety of the "tumblr-code.html" file. Right click and select copy (or type Ctrl-C/Cmd-C on your keyboard).
4. Select all of the HTML code in the "Edit HTML" box. Right click and select paste (or type Ctrl-V/Cmd-V on your keyboard).
5. Click the "Update Preview" button in the side panel. The preview box should look something like this: http://alexidavis.com/projects/wandel-theme/screens/install-screen.png
6. Click the "Save" button, then select the arrow icon next to the gear icon.
7. You'll now see a box under the Title and Description boxes, with a heading reading "Appearance",
	that will allow you to select which color scheme you'd like. The options are: Blue, Grey, Pink, Purple, and Red

### If you'd like to make use of the mobile responsive options, there's one more thing you'll need to do:
1. Click "Advanced Options" at the bottom of the side panel.
2. Find the option that says, "Use optimized mobile layout" and switch it off.
	(This allows the theme to respond via media queries as it's built to, rather than displaying
		Tumblr's default mobile theme on mobile devices.)
